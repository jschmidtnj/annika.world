biography: >-
  Annika is a filmmaker, tattoo artist, musician, and multimedia visual artist
  based in New York. As an emerging writer-director and video editor, Annika is
  committed to shifting representational paradigms of identities traditionally
  marginalized in American media. 


  Recurring topics within Annika’s creative practice include queer love and identity, issues of disability and mental health, and constructions of reality and selfhood in a technologized world. Annika’s filmmaking practice tells bold and subversive stories which propagate multidimensional representations—transforming minds and shifting cultural paradigms. 


  Annika utilizes a deeply layered approach to storytelling, intensifying visual and musical narratives through a process of fragmentation and collage, in order to evoke variable states of consciousness and subjectivities in perception. The result is a bold and energized body of work inviting dissection. 


  Annika’s interdisciplinary undergraduate concentration studies the intersection of filmmaking, psychology, philosophy, multimedia art, and writing, which ultimately guides them to produce artworks which probe the mind.


  Annika’s artistic practices outside of filmmaking include tattooing, poetry and prose, comics, music production, DJing, fine art, and textile design.
